    <p> JavaScript is a language that runs inside web browsers as part of the documents loaded by the browser and is used as a client-side development language. It provides the behavior of the pages. Like HTML it provides the semantic structure and CSS the look and feel.
                However, being an interpreted language, it needs an interpreter to run. V8 is Google Chrome's JS engine and 'node' is a front-end that can be used to run JavaScript scripts outside the browser.

                NodeJs is an open source, cross-platform environment that allows to create server-side applications and tools using JavaScript.</p>
